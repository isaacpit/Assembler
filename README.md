# assembler
This project is tied in with The Elements of Computing Systems textbook by Noam Nissan and Shimon Schocken. The purpose of the project is to take on the role of the HACK assembler supplied. The goal is to take a given .asm file in the HACK format and convert this file into machine code for the HACK computer to interpret and run. The input file will be in form <FILE>.asm and will output a file of the form <FILE>.hack which is an executable file that a HACK platform machine is capable of running. 
  
# How to run
1. type the following command into preferred command line interpreter
```
make
```
2. run the executable with 
```
./main
```
3. enter the name of the file to be converted when prompted
4. finished
